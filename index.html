                        <p>
                            Fresenius Kabi is a pharmaceutical company where I have worked
                            as a supervisor. At Fresenius Kabi, I was responsible for a
                            group of employees where I oversee eight process operators,
                            production and manufacturing. I place great emphasis on accuracy
                            and quality. My duties included, among other things, to coach,
                            educate and train new employees. Besides that, I work a lot with
                            planning and recruiting employees. During this time at the
                            company, I have attended both internal and external leadership
                            courses and my knowledge in the production and manufacture of
                            pharmaceuticals has developed. I am also trained in GMP and
                            electrical cabinet safety. Review of batch documentation was
                            part of my duties and supervise review according to GMP and the

                        <h4>Process operator, Fresenius Kabi</h4>
                        <p>
                            As a process operator, you need to be used to working at a high
                            pace. Have a good awareness of quality and thus be very accurate
                            in my execution. I enjoyed both practical and administrative
                            work.
