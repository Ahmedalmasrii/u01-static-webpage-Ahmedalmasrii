                            <h4>Teamleader, Fresenius Kabi</h4>
                            <p> Fresenius Kabi is a pharmaceutical company where
                                I have worked as a supervisor. At Fresenius Kabi,
                                I was responsible for a group of employees where
                                I oversee eight process operators, production and
                                manufacturing. I place great emphasis on accuracy
                                and quality. My duties included, among other things,
                                to coach, educate and train new employees. Besides
                                that, I work a lot with planning and recruiting employees.
                                During this time at the company, I have attended both
                                internal and external leadership courses and my
                                knowledge in the production and manufacture of
                                pharmaceuticals has developed. I am also trained in
                                GMP and electrical cabinet safety. Review of batch
                                documentation was part of my duties and supervise
                                review according to GMP and the company work</p>

                                <h4>Process operator, Fresenius Kabi</h4>
                                <p>
                                    As a process operator, you need to be used to
                                    working at a high pace. Have a good awareness
                                    of quality and thus be very accurate in my execution.
                                    I enjoyed both practical and administrative work.</p>
