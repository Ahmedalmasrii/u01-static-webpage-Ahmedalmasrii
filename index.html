                <p>
            Fresenius Kabi is a pharmaceutical company where I have worked as a
            supervisor. At Fresenius Kabi, I was responsible for a group of
            employees where I oversee eight process operators, production and
            manufacturing. I place great emphasis on accuracy and quality. My
            duties included, among other things, to coach, educate and train new
            employees. Besides that, I work a lot with planning and recruiting
            employees. During this time at the company, I have attended both
            internal and external leadership courses and my knowledge in the
            production and manufacture of pharmaceuticals has developed. I am also
            trained in GMP and electrical cabinet safety. Review of batch
            documentation was part of my duties and supervise review according to
            GMP and the company work
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Process operator, Fresenius Kabi</h4>
          <p>
            As a process operator, you need to be used to working at a high pace.
            Have a good awareness of quality and thus be very accurate in my
            execution. I enjoyed both practical and administrative work.
